# Installation

This guide will walk you through installing the essential tools needed for this Python programming course. You'll need **Git** for version control, **VS Code** as your code editor, and **Flowgorithm** for creating visual flowcharts.

## Git

### What is Git

**Git** is a distributed version control system that records every change you make to your code, lets you rewind to any previous state, and supports branching so you can safely experiment without affecting your `main` work.


### Installing Git

1. Go to https://git-scm.com/download/win — the download should begin automatically.

2. Double-click the downloaded `Git-version-64-bit.exe` file and click `Next` on the welcome screen.

3. `Select Destination Location`: You can accept the default or choose any locations that you like.

4. `Select Components`: Leave everything as is.

5. `Choosing the default editor used by Git`: Choose the default. 
   
6. `Adjusting the name of the initial branch in new repositories`: Choose the default. 
   
7. `Adjusting your PATH environment`: Choose `Git from the command line and also from 3rd-party software.`

::: info NOTE
The PATH environment variable in **Windows** tells the system where to look for executable programs when you type a command in command prompt. If you ever see this option again, it's almost always a good idea to tick off the box.
:::

8. `Choosing the SSH executable`: Choose the default.
   
9. `Choosing HTTPS transport backend`: Leave `Use the OpenSSL library`
    
10. `Configuring line endings`: Choose `Checkout Windows-style, commit Unix-style line endings.`
    
11. `Configuring the terminal emulator to use with Git Bash`: Choose `Use MinTTY.`
    
12. `Choose the default behaviour of git pull`: Choose the default
    
13. `Choose the credential helper`: Choose `Git Credential Manager`.
    
14. `Configuring extra options`: Choose the default.
    
15. Click `Install`, it should take a few minutes and you are good to go!

## VS Code

### What is VS Code

**Visual Studio Code** (**VS Code**) is a free, open-source, cross-platform code editor from **Microsoft**. It combines a clean, lightweight interface with powerful features that help you write, run, and debug code—all in one place.

Why we use **VS Code** in this course:

- Built-in **Python** support (via **Microsoft's** **Python** extension) gives you syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion (IntelliSense), and easy access to virtual environments.
- Integrated terminal lets you run **Git** commands, **Python** scripts, or any shell commands without leaving the editor.
- Built-in debugger makes it simple to set breakpoints, inspect variables, and step through your **Python** code visually.

### Installing VS Code

1. Go to https://code.visualstudio.com/ and click `Download for Windows`.
   
2. Double-click the downloaded `VSCodeUserSetup-x64-*.exe`.

3. `Select Additional Tasks`: Maintain the defaults, but it is recommended to tick off the `Create a desktop icon` box.

4. Click `Install`, then `Finish`.
