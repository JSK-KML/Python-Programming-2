# Lab Style Guide

This document defines the standards for writing labs. Follow these rules to ensure all labs have a consistent look and feel.

---

## 1. Required Sections (In Order)

Every lab **must** include these sections in this exact order:

1.  **Title & Frontmatter**
    ```yaml
    ---
    outline: deep
    title: Lab X - [Topic Name]
    ---
    # Lab XX: [Topic Name]
    ```

2.  **Pull and Update in VS Code** (Boilerplate - copy verbatim)
    ```markdown
    ## Pull and Update in VS Code

    Before starting any lab, you need to make sure that the repo in your **GitHub** is the latest one. [Sync the repo](./lab-01.md#syncing-fork) if the `upstream` repo have been updated.

    Once the online repo is in-sync, bring those changes down to your PC by clicking `Source Control` and then `...` beside `Changes` and click `Pull`.

        <img src="/public/labs/lab-02/lab-2-1.png" alt="drawing" width="400"/>
    </p>
    ```

3.  **Concept Introduction** - Explain the "Why" and "What".
4.  **Guided Sandbox** - Students follow along in `exercise.py`.
5.  **Exercises** - Graded tasks, each in its own folder (`exerciseX/`).
6.  **Commit and Push Your Work** (Boilerplate - copy verbatim)
    ```markdown
    ## Commit and Push Your Work

    After completing all exercises, save all your files and commit them to your repository...
    ```

---

## 2. Badge Usage

Use **only one badge type** for questions and tasks:

```html
<Badge type="warning" text="Task" />
```

**Example:**
```markdown
### Exercise 1: Score Calculator <Badge type="warning" text="Task" />
```

**Do NOT use:** `<Badge type="tip" text="Question" />` or other badge variants for exercises.

---

## 3. Language & Tone

| Rule | Example |
|------|---------|
| **Use "you" (second person)** | "Before you start...", "You will see..." |
| **Give direct commands** | "Copy this code...", "Run this...", "Try changing..." |
| **Prompt reflection after code** | "What do you see?", "Can you figure out...?" |
| **Explain the "Why"** | "**Why 4 spaces?** The answer is..." |
| **Use analogies** | "Think of it like a toolbox..." |
| **Lower stakes** | "Don't worry about...", "Take it easy." |

---

## 4. Pedagogical Flow

### A. Staged Evolution
Start with simple/incomplete code. Evolve it step-by-step to reveal the need for new concepts.

**Pattern:**
1.  Show simple code.
2.  Ask a question that reveals its limitation.
    > ::: warning PROBLEM
    > Our program only handles the success case.
3.  Introduce the new feature that solves it.

### B. Show "Wrong Code"
Deliberately show broken code or common mistakes. Explain *why* it's wrong.

**Pattern:**
```python
# WRONG - This will cause an infinite loop!
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    # Forgot to increment count!
```
> "What do you think will happen?"

### C. Prompt Experimentation
After working code, tell students to try different values.

> "Test this with different values: `marks = 95`, `marks = 45`, `marks = 0`."

---

## 5. Visuals

### A. Screenshots
-   Centered with `<p align="center">`.
-   Fixed width: `width="300"` or `width="400"`.
-   Used for VS Code UI guidance.

### B. ASCII Diagrams
Use for abstract concepts that can't be captured in a screenshot.

### C. Tables
Use for summarizing operators, comparisons, or reference material.

---

## 6. Callout Blocks

Use VitePress `:::` blocks:

| Type | Usage |
|------|-------|
| `::: tip` | Best practices, helpful hints. |
| `::: warning` | Common mistakes, pitfalls, problems with current code. |
| `::: danger` | Critical information, things that will break. |
| `::: info` | General notes (use sparingly). |

---

## 7. Exercise Format

Each exercise should:
1.  Be in its own folder: `/labs/labXX/exerciseY/`.
2.  Have a main file: `exerciseY.py`.
3.  Provide skeleton code with `input()` and `print()` pre-written.
4.  Use the `# TODO: Your code here` comment.

**Example:**
```python
price = float(input())

# TODO: Your code here

print(item_count)
print(f"{total_cost:.2f}")
```

---

## 8. Naming Conventions

-   **Variables:** `snake_case` (e.g., `student_grade`, `total_bill`).
-   **Files:** Lowercase with hyphens (e.g., `lab-01.md`, `exercise1.py`).
-   **Folders:** Lowercase, no spaces (e.g., `exercise1`, `lab01`).
